[0h h1](https://0hh1.com) solver.

## TODO

- add typescript
- dark mode
- use same font as [0hh1.com](0hh1.com) - JosefinSans-Bold
- maybe add possibilty to highlight initial state (easier way to copy solution)
- beffer ukrainian flag shades
- add share button with permalink (and `/puzzle/<repr>` route)
- add "check solution" button
- add title
- better error popup (sticky on top right)
- better button position (lateral buttons on desktop)
- better size selection buttons
- fix size issues (12x12 is way too big)
- change things so that right click in the middle of the tiles doesnt bring up context menu
    - either preventDefault on contextmenu on all of the main Board div 
	- or use padding instead of gap? (with second option, even a slightly missed click would result in a successfull tile coloring)
